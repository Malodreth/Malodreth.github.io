									<h6>Note: The following is a short story I'm writing. I don't really know where I'm going with it. So far it's just a work-in-progress. I'll intermittently post updates to it here.</h6>							
									<div class="well">
										<p>&emsp;&emsp;Last Thursday I had an appointment with Kelly in HR to review an incident that had allegedly occurred at work during one of my shifts. I was on my third day of suspension and the fact of the matter was that I had no clue as to why they had even suspended me. I was eager to get the issue resolved as soon as possible so I could return to work without losing any more hours on my pay cheque.</p>   
										<p>The meeting was scheduled for 3 PM and I arrived to the workplace about 15 minutes before. I waited in the car, sweating all over myself — both because of the heat (<em>it was a 104 degree day!</em>) and because I was extremely nervous. I messed with the radio for a bit until I found a classic rock station that was playing a song I liked. I stretched out my legs and sang along to calm my nerves but all I could focus on was the fear that I might be getting fired.</p>
										<p>About 2:55 PM I got out of the car and started for the main office. My co-worker, Matt, passed me outside the lobby as I neared the front of the building. He paused for a moment, eyeing me with suspicion. <em>Did he know something that I didn't?</em> I worried, but then he tossed me a nod, “’Sup, bro?”.</p>
										<p>“Nothin’ much, man,” I replied cautiously, “How about you?”</p>
										<p>“Makin’ that easy money!” he beamed.</p> 
										<p>My soul cringed as he said this — I fucking <em>hate it</em> when people use that expression. More to the point, I can’t stand the entire “bro thing” altogether. But I offered up a polite chuckle, nonetheless, and shot back — “you know it!” — before continuing on my way. But Matt’s hand reached out to stop me.</p> 
										<p>“Hey, bro,” he said sternly, “aren’t you forgetting something?” His eyes narrowed in on my face as he spoke, and from the smell of his breath I could tell that he had eaten garlic cheese fries for lunch earlier that day.</p> 
										<p>I winced, “What do you mean?”</p>
										<p>He looked at me for a moment and then put out his fist. “Oh!” I said, bumping his fist with my own.</p>
										<p>“That’s what I’m talkin’ ‘bout!” he replied with a sneer. “I’ll catch you later.”</p>
										<p>“Yep, sure.” I continued on ahead.</p>
										<br />
										<p>&emsp;&emsp;There was a chill on the air as I walked through the front lobby to the receptionist’s desk. I couldn’t tell if it was caused by the cold draft of the air curtain on the way in or if the chill running down my spine decided to leave my body.</p>
										<p>“Hi, can I help you?” the girl at the desk asked me, her eyes fixed on her computer. Her name badge read ‘Kristin’. I figured she must’ve been a new hire because I had never seen her before.</p>
										<p>“Hey! Um, well,” I hesitated, “I’m here to see Kelly Bowers. I was told to be here around 3 o’clock.”</p>
										<p>Kristin replied with a question, but I found myself too distracted by the extraordinarily firm way her breasts bounced as she got up from her chair to look at me. “What is your name?” she asked again, smirking.
										“Oh! Um, it’s—“</p>
										 <p>“—<em>get yo fuckin’ hands offa me!</em>” someone shouted from the hallway. I turned just in time to see the reason for the commotion. The person shouting was a man being forcibly shoved out of the building by two security guards. His face and arms were filthy and he had on a really weird variety of ill-fitting, ratty clothes. “Let... me... the <em>fuck</em>... alone! Y’all wouldn’t even be <em>doin’</em> this if I was white!” he continued.</p>
										<p>“What’s that about?” I asked.</p>
										<p>Kristin looked both ways and then whispered, “He was just fired!”.</p>
										<p>“Really?” My heart felt heavy in my chest.</p>
										<p>“L-O-L! Of course not!” she laughed. “A housekeeper caught him shooting up in the bathroom and told security. I guess he walked in on an earlier shift and asked whoever was sitting here at that time if he could use the bathroom, but he didn’t leave.”</p>
										<p>“Ha,” I laughed, “wow. That’s just—“</p>
										<p>“—Come with me!” another voice from behind interrupted.</p>
										<p>“<em>Huh?</em> Oh.” It was Louis, one of the two security guards that was dealing with the homeless guy.</p>
										<p>“Follow me!" he repeated. "I’m supposed to take you to Kelly’s office."</p>
